# Pi-hole and Cloudflare Tunnel Client Using Docker Compose

###### \* _credit goes to **apavamontri** for original code (see: https://github.com/apavamontri/pi-hole-cloudflared-docker)_ *
<br><br>
BLUF: This project will allow you to use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to run [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) and [Cloudflare Tunnel Client](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared) together to achieve [DNS-Over-HTTPS](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/cloudflared/). Not to mention domain-level ad blocking!

NOTE: If your use case is to block [YouTube](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/youtube-ads-getting-through-pihole-any-advances-in-100-blocking-without-also-blocking-youtube-videos/60951) or Hulu ads... find another use case ðŸ˜œ.


# Requirements

- Whichever flavor of Linux you feel like troubleshooting (I'm using CentOS Stream 9)
- Docker Compose or Docker Desktop (Docker install scripts for [RHEL/CentOS Stream 8-9](./install-docker_rhel8-9.sh) and [Pi OS](./install-docker_pi-os.sh) included in this repo)
- (OPTIONAL) [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/access/) account for enhanced DNS capabilities

# Instructions

1. (OPTIONAL) Create/[log into](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) your Cloudflare account and Navigate to **Zero Trust** from the lefthand menu. Expand _Gateway_ and select _DNS Locations_.

2. (OPTIONAL) Click the blue **Add a location** button. Choose whichever name you'd like (this matters to no one but you), then click the _Add IP_ button; this should auto-populate with your current public address.

3. (OPTIONAL) Check the _Set as Default DNS Location_ box and click _Add location_ in the bottom-right.

4. (OPTIONAL) Click on your newly created location under the **Location name** menu. Under _Location details_, record the two **IPv4** addresses as well as the **DNS over HTTPS** URL. Save those three values for later. (Those IPv4 aadresses are essentially your personal _1.1.1.1_ and _1.0.0.1_ with enhanced security options)

5. Make sure Docker Desktop is running by running the following command in the terminal.

```bash
docker --version
```

It should return something like this

```text
Docker version 20.10.21, build baeda1f
```

6. You can change the configuration values of Pi-hole and Cloudflare Tunnel Client in the [compose.yml](./compose.yml) file (I advise you leave the CONTAINER names as is; another script relies on them being named, "pihole" and cloudflared". HOSTNAME changes will affect nothing but the joy in your heart).

   - Docker Pi-hole's [Environment Variables](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/#environment-variables)
   - Cloudflare Tunnel Client's [Environment Variables](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/blob/master/cmd/cloudflared/proxydns/cmd.go)

7. To build the Docker containers, run [build-pihole.sh](./build-pihole.sh)

```bash
sudo ./build-pihole.sh
```

This bash script will:

a. Ask for your intended Web Admin password (the ```password.txt``` file is populated, used for the Docker build, then deleted for security).

b. Start Docker Compose in detached mode.

c. Build your containers to spec (successfully, one would hope).

8. (MacOS ONLY) If you are running MacOS, you have one more step prior to accessing the Web Admin page: run [macos-config.sh](./macos-config.sh) to set your WiFi DNS to the Pi-hole (DISCLAIMER: I don't completely understand why this is needed because I love myself too much to be out here running MacOS on anything. It's 2024 people; self-care is in! Get y'all an Android and ditch the MacBook... \#teampixel).

```bash
sudo ./macos-config.sh
```

# Pi-hole Web Admin UI

Once the Pi-hole Docker container has started, you can access Pi-hole's Web Admin UI at [http://localhost:8061/admin](http://localhost:8061/admin).

Enter the Web Admin password you set earlier.

You can check the [Upstream DNS Servers](http://localhost:8061/admin/settings.php?tab=dns) by navigating to _Settings_ on the lefthand side and selecting the DNS tab. You should see the IP address set for your Cloudflare Tunnel Client under **Custom 1 (IPv4)**.
