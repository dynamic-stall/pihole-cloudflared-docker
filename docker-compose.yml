  ## Reference the 'custom-network.sh' file, if you intend on going with a custom bridge or macvlan setup...
  ## Then, un-comment lines 98-99 and delete or comment out the "pihole" network declarations (lines 83-89)...
  ## Then, you'll need to change lines 28 and 78 from "pihole" to the custom name (i.e., "law-net")...
  ## Then, of course, you'll also need to update your IPs to match the subnet range you created.
  
  ## OR, you can delete everything below line 89, as well, if this ain't your jam!
